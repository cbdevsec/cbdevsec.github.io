<h2 id="opportunities-and-challenges">opportunities and challenges:</h2>
<p>Improving operational efficiencies is retail’s biggest AI opportunity, recruiting and retaining AI experts and data scientists are major challenges to achieving AI goals.</p>
<p>Nearly 50% of retailers believe generative AI is strategic and will be a differentiator in the market, transforming customer experiences is the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p>Data privacy is the biggest concern, Rigorous testing is conducted to ensure AI systems do not reinforce stereotypes or exclude customer groups, While AI enhances experiences, LVMH carefully balances automation with human interaction to maintain the brand’s luxury values.</p>
<p>While investment levels in AI are small in comparison to industry capex, over 60% of retail respondents plan to increase their AI infrastructure investment in the next 18 months; retailers are investing in multiple, diverse AI use cases spanning various business functions.</p>
<p>Regardless of Investment levels in generative AI being small in comparison to industry capex too, retailers are still being conservative with investment levels in generative AI, planned investments are smaller than planned investments in AI.</p>
<p>Therefore, over 50% of retailers prefer to deploy a hybrid approach for their AI solutions. And over 20 percent of retailers plan to use generative AI through software vendors that are creating solutions.</p>
<p>AI’s positive impact on revenue, operating costs, and operational efficiencies:</p>
<p>2024 has seen a significant positive impact of AI on revenue, sustainability, and operating costs in luxury retail.</p>
<p>69% of retailers currently using AI believe that it has contributed to an increase in their annual revenue with 28% reporting an increase of 5 to 10% and an additional 15% reporting an increase of 15%. “C-suite executives reported even stronger results, with 57 percent asserting that AI has driven both an annual revenue increase and an operating cost decrease above 15 percent.” While 72% of them saw a 15% decrease in costs.</p>
<p>“Retailers have varying capital expenditures, ranging from $6 billion for grocery and food to $68 billion for online retail. Considering these numbers, AI investment levels seem relatively low. Among all retailers, 68 percent invested less than $5 million in AI infrastructure this year, while only 12 percent invested more than $50 million. Among retailers with annual revenues exceeding $500 million, however, results are more favorable. While 47 percent invested less than $5 million in AI infrastructure this year, another 27 percent invested more than $50 million” a recent study by NYU Stern states.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits to implementing AI, it can also come with challenges. Beyond financing AI infrastructure, retailers who adopted AI shared their three primary challenges: inadequate technology, recruiting and retaining AI experts and data scientists, and having sufficient data for the best accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="retailers-prefer-partnerships-when-implementing-ai">Retailers prefer partnerships when implementing AI:</h2>
<p>“52 percent of all retailers opt for a hybrid approach. Results are even more pronounced among retailers with annual revenues exceeding $500 million, with a remarkable 63 percent leaning toward a hybrid approach.”</p>
<h2 id="retailers-are-embracing-generative-ai-at-different-paces">Retailers are embracing generative AI at different paces:</h2>
<p>Most retailers see GenAI as a strategic tool that can differentiate them in the market. Conversely, a cautious “wait and watch” approach is being adopted by a substantial segment, 39 percent, potentially due to concerns about the technology’s complexity, costs, or compatibility with existing systems.</p>
<p>While many retailers are optimistic about the potential benefits of generative AI, the industry is in the early stages of exploring technology, with varying levels of readiness with 77% of retailers willing to invest no more than $5M in generative AI.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-marketing-and-content-generation">transforming marketing and content generation:</h2>
<p>Among all retailers surveyed, 68 percent want to use generative AI to transform marketing and content generation. This underscores the belief that generative AI can offer innovative solutions for use cases like automating content generation (text, imagery, audio, video), tailoring campaigns, and delivering more personalized and compelling messaging to customers, ultimately driving business growth.</p>
